# PlayerMusic

This project is a study of the AVKit Framework, I tried to emulate the functionality of the Moses app. <br>

In this project given a track you can: <br>

- choose the listening volume<br>
- choose the listening side (R&L) <br>
- Speed up or slow down the Bpm of the song <br>
<br>
<br>
The app is fully accessible, and for future implementations I am studying SiriKit to improve accessibility
